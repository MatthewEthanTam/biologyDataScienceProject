# Biology Data Science Project

I want to make this project a way for Biology students to explore coding and the wonders of computers in a space that people enjoy using coding as a tool

# Lesson 1: Getting the data (Cloning the repository)

PS: if you know how to do this skip to lesson 2

Since this project is designed for people who are either new to coding or have never used types of version control such as `github`, `gitlab`, or `bitbucket`, I will be going over how to clone this repository to your computer.

## 1. Opening the terminal

The terminal is a way to interact with your computer using text commands. It is a very powerful tool that can be used to do many things. For this project we will be using it to clone the repository to your computer.

### Mac

To open the terminal on a mac, you can either search for it in spotlight by holding `âŒ˜` and `space` and searching for `terminal` or you can go to `Applications` -> `Utilities` -> `Terminal` and click on the icon. This will open the terminal.

### Windows

To open the terminal on a windows computer, you can search for it in the search bar by clicking on the windows icon in the bottom left corner of your screen and searching for `cmd` or `command prompt`. This will open the terminal.

### Linux

To open the terminal on a linux computer, you can hold `Ctrl` and `Alt` and press `T`. This will open the terminal. If thi does not work you can right click on the desktop and click `Open in Terminal`. This will open the terminal.

## 2. Cloning the repository
